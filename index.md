## About me
I started learning Data Science in September 2020. I discovered, that this field of IT is much more than just supplying our daily lives with technology. I see it as a tool to see the world with more detail, excavating information not visible at first sight and drawing informed conclusions about it. As I see myself as a person who loves to look for the deeper meaning behind the processes we see in everyday life, this is very appealing to me.

## Project 1: [Climate Change Overview](https://github.com/Sz-klarnia/Climat-change-overview/)

* I analysed and visualized data concerning various factors contributing to Global Warming, such as co2 emission and concentration levels, land use emissions and forestation levels to find out how they interact and contribute to overall warming of the planet
* I prepared three scenarios of future greenhouse gasses emissions based on our actions as a humanity and predicted future concentration levels in each of them.
* I optimized various regression models (Linear, Trees, Forests and XGBoost), chose the best one and predicted future temperature levels in each of them, to see which scenario gives us a chance of avoiding warming the planet above 2 degrees cecius.
* I consider this project to be a work-in-progress and plan to add more factors and anaylses to make my predictions as close to IPCC's as I can

## Project 2: [Ideology or people? Polish press language used in LGBT+ issues coverage](https://github.com/Sz-klarnia/NLP---Press-coverage-of-LBGT-issues)

* Using BeautifulSoup and Selenium I scraped over 3000 articles on the LGBT+ issues from various polish portals
* I cleared and prepared the texts for analysis
* Using NLTK and Spacy I lemmatized the texts, created word clouds and collocations lists for each newscaster
* Using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV i optimalized various classification models (LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest, SVM and XGBoost) to classify the articles as "hostile" or "friendly" towards LGBT+ community

## Project 3: [20 years of US Wildfires](https://github.com/Sz-klarnia/NLP---Press-coverage-of-LBGT-issues)

* I analysed the data to find out if fires are getting bigger, more intense and more frequent over the years
* I prepared various visualisations of fire distributon around the US
* Using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimalize classification models to predict the cause of the fire based on fire size, location and date of discovery. Model achieved high recall, meaning that it identifies most of existing fires from each class and can be used to predict wether a fire was caused by human negligence or arson and investigate it further.
